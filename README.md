# Academic Certificate Verification System Using Blockchain
 Academic Certificate Verification System Using Blockchain


The proposed solution consists of a web app which will have an interface for
registration and verification of certificate along with a private blockchain in the
backend which will be used to store and verify certificates.

In a blockchain-based system for verifying educational certificates, there are 
typically three main actors involved: the Admin (Certificate Issuer), the Student 
(Certificate Holder), and the Verifier.
The Certificate Issuer, also known as the Admin, is responsible for creating and 
issuing the certificates on the blockchain. This actor is typically a trusted authority, 
such as a university or educational institution, that has the authority to issue certificates 
to students upon completion of their studies. The Admin creates a digital record of the 
certificate on the blockchain, which includes important details such as the student's 
30
name, the name of the institution, the date of issuance, and other relevant information. 
Once the certificate is issued on the blockchain, it becomes a permanent and tamperproof record.
The Certificate Holder, or the Student, is the individual who holds the certificate 
and wishes to share it with others for verification purposes. This actor is responsible for 
providing access to their certificate when requested by a Verifier. The Certificate 
Holder typically has control over their certificate and can choose who has access to it 
and for what purposes.
Finally, the Verifier is the party responsible for verifying the authenticity and 
validity of the certificate. This actor can be an employer, a regulatory body, or any other 
entity that requires verification of educational credentials. The Verifier can request 
access to the Certificate Holder's certificate and can use the blockchain to verify its 
authenticity and accuracy. By verifying the certificate on the blockchain, the Verifier 
can be confident that the certificate is genuine and has not been tampered.

Following will be the working process of the system. 
1) University grants a degree certificate and enters the studentâ€™s data into the 
system. Next, the system automatically generates block form blockchain by 
adding hash of the certificate or it can be a collection of certificates.
2) The certificate hash is generated then email is sent to student containing hash 
value for the certificate.
3) The companies check e-certificates details to website and match to existing hash 
value. If the Hash value matches, then all e- certificates are valid else there may 
be document forgery might be carried out.
